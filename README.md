## Methodology  

The analysis combines **Multinomial Logit (MNL)** and **Hierarchical Bayes (HB)** models to estimate consumer preferences from a Choice-Based Conjoint (CBC) experiment. The study focuses on the skincare industry, analyzing the impact of:  
- Social media platforms (Instagram vs. TikTok)  
- Influencer type (dermatologists, cosmetologists, beauty influencers)  
- Follower count (micro, mid-tier, macro)  
- Personal experience sharing  
- Discount strategies  

## Key Findings  

- Expert influencers (dermatologists, cosmetologists) had a stronger positive effect on brand choice compared to beauty influencers.  
- Instagram was generally preferred over TikTok, though younger users valued TikTok more.  
- Moderate discounts increased purchase intention, while excessive discounting reduced credibility.  
- Stable and predictable pricing reinforced long-term brand trust.
